# Image-Payload-Creating-tools
Creating an image payload is a technique used in penetration testing and red teaming to deliver a payload (such as a reverse shell) to a target system by hiding it within an image file. Here's an example of how you can use the Python library pillow to create an image payload:


This script takes an original image and adds the payload (in this case, a string encoded in base64) to the image's metadata. By doing this the payload is hidden within the image and can be delivered to the target without detection.

You can also use other tools such as steghide, outguess, and stegsolve to hide payloads in images. These tools allow you to hide payloads in the least significant bits of the image data, making them harder to detect.

It's important to note that payloads can be detected by Anti-virus software or other security measures, so you need to be aware of that and choose the appropriate payload. This technique should only be used in a controlled and legal environment, such as a penetration testing engagement where you have obtained proper authorization.
